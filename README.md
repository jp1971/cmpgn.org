# wordpress-quick-start

Lets get WordPress up and running quickly! This wordpress runs on a [Vagrant Box](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html) virtual machine, bootstrapped with a composer.json file. The front end dependencies are handled with [Bower](http://bower.io/) and build processes are handeled by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). The CSS preprocesser is [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

##GETTING RUNNING!

First, in terminal, cd into the quickstart directory, run the install_wordpress.sh file with the command:

```
./install_wordpress.sh
```

This will install the latest verison of WordPress to the webroot.
